## Description

For our 3rd Bootcamp challenge, we had to edit starter code for JavaSript. We had to add variables, if statements, as well as functions to get a working password generator. The user is prompted with what character values they would like to be in their password. They have 4 available options to choose from, such as symbols, numbers, upper case and lower case letters, as well as the option to not choose anything at all.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Go to https://github.com/kmfox1087/Bootcamp-Challenge-3 and copy SSH 
* Use _git clone_ in your terminal and copy and paste the SSH code to your local computer
* Use _git status_ to make sure you are in the repo, if not use _cd Bootcamp-Challenge-3_ in your terminal to change into your local repo
* After clone is complete, type code . into your terminal to edit files as you need
